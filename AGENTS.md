# Codex Readme

## Guidance

Unless specifically instructed otherwise:

- Don't maintain backwards compatability.
- Don't leave requested functionality for later implementation.
- Don't use clippy ignores.
- Don't leave dead/unused code.
- Don't hardcoded numeric values in comments.

- Do ensure the project builds and passes linting.
- Do match implementations with surrounding code.
- Do prefer small, focused modules over large files.
